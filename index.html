        <p>Here's my rough itinerary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>10:00 AM - 1:00 PM | working at Red Hook Farms on Columbia Street</li>
          <li>1:00 PM - 2:30 PM | getting takeout lunch from somewhere in Red Hook and eating it at Strong Rope Brewery</li>
          <li>2:30 PM - 8:00 PM | hanging out at Valentino Pier Park with my banjo</li>
          <li>8:00 PM - late | bar hopping, probably between some combination of Sunny's, Fort Defiance, and Seaborne (if it's open)</li>
        </ul>
